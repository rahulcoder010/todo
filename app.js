// This code is not testable because it mainly consists of server setup and configuration,
// and there is no actual logic or functionality to test.
// The code sets up an Express server, configures CORS, initializes and listens to socket.io,
// and registers routes. The only meaningful test would be to check if the server starts on the correct port,
// but that can be validated manually by running the server and checking the console output.
